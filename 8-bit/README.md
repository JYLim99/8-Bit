## Proposed Level of Achievement
Project Gemini

## Tech Stack

ReactJS and Firebase. We chose ReactJS for our frontend as it is faster and it is simpler to use with its good documentation. It is also adequate for our purpose as a gaming website. We chose Firebase for our backend for its simplicity and ease of use for beginners. Firebase takes care of most of the backend intricacies which allows us to focus more on the other aspects of development.

## Motivation
Popular games from the past may be forgotten by youth. We wish to introduce them to the games that were once very popular in the 80s so that they can have some fun.

## Aim of Project
A web based application that serves as a collection of these games would allow users to find and play these games conveniently. Users can access the website to play the game whenever they want to. Our website aims to incorporate a leaderboard and multiplayer feature so that users will be able to play with their friends as this feature is not found in other popular gaming websites.

## Scope of Project

A website where users can click on images (similar to Y8/Miniclip) and play vintage games. Users can also learn more about the game history while they are playing those games
