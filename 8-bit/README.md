## Proposed Level of Achievement
Project Gemini

## Motivation
Popular games from the past may be **forgotten by the younger generation**. The authenticity and history of these games may not be relatable to the younger generation.

For the older generation, it may be hard to find all these games within the same platform. Currently even though the games may be found easily online, but they are quite scattered. There is a lack of web applications that gathers all of these games.

## Aim of Project
We wish to reintroduce popular games from the past to the current generation. Pong, Space Invaders and Breakout were famous games during their time. It is also a platform for the older generation to relive their childhood.

A web based application that serves as a collection of these games would allow users to find and play these games conveniently. Users can access the website to play the game whenever they want to.

## Scope of Project

A website where users can click on images (similar to Y8/Miniclip) and play vintage games. Users can also learn more about the game history while they are playing those games
