## Proposed Level of Achievement
Project Gemini

## Motivation
Popular games from the past may be **forgotten by the younger generation**. The authenticity and history of these games may not be relatable to the younger generation.

For the **older generation**, it may be hard to find all these games within the same platform. Currently even though the games may be found easily online, but they are quite scattered. There is a lack of web applications that gathers all of these games.

## Aim of Project
We wish to reintroduce popular games from the past to the current generation. Pong, Space Invaders and Breakout were famous games during their time. It is also a platform for the older generation to relive their childhood.

A web based application that serves as a collection of these games would allow users to find and play these games conveniently. Users can access the website to play the game whenever they want to.

## Scope of Project

A website where users can click on images (similar to Y8/Miniclip) and play vintage games. Users can also learn more about the game history while they are playing those games

## Features
